# Semantic-Liver-Segmentation

## About the Project
This repository contains code for the segmentation of liver tumors from medical 
imaging data, specifically focusing on images from CT (computed tomography) scans. The goal of 
the project is to develop my understanding in medical imaging and create an automated, 
accurate tool for identifying and segmenting liver tumors, which is crucial for diagnostic purposes,
treatment planning, and monitoring the progression of the disease.
